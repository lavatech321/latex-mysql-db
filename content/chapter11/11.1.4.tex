		\item BCNF is stricter than 3NF.
		\item If a non-primary key column is determining any other column, the table is not in BCNF.
		
		\item Example (without BCNF):
		Letâ€™s consider the following table of university class assignments:
		
		\newimage{0.36}{content/chapter11/images/bcnf1.png}
			
		\item Here, the Course\_ID determines the Instructor, but the Room\_Number is not determined by the Course\_ID alone because the same course (CS101) can be taught in different rooms by the same instructor. 
		\item So the table violates BCNF because the Room\_Number depends on both the Course\_ID and the Instructor.
		
		\item To bring it into BCNF, we need to split the table:
		
		\newimage{0.36}{content/chapter11/images/bcnf2.png}
		
		\item Now, the data is in BCNF because:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In Table 1, Course\_ID is the candidate key, and it determines the Instructor.
			\item In Table 2, Instructor is the candidate key, and it determines the Room\_Number.
			
		\end{itemize}
