	\begin{itemize}
		\item The degree of dependency between the components is called \textbf{coupling}.
		\item If dependency is more, then it is considered as \textbf{tightly coupling}.
		\item If dependency is less, then it is considered as \textbf{lossly coupling}.
		\item Eg:
		\codeblockfull{A.java}{
			class B \{ \\
			\s	static int i=100; \\
			\} \\
			class A \{ \\
			\s	static int i = B.i; // \textbf{Tightly coupled} \\
			\s	public static void main(String[] args) \{ \\
			\s	\s	System.out.println(A.i); // Output: 100 \\
			\s	\} \\
			\}
		}

		\item \textbf{Tightly coupling is not good} programming practise.
		\item Lossly coupling is a good programming practice.
		\newpage
		\item Problem with tightly coupling:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cannot modify component without dependency problem.
			\item Reduce reuseability. 
			\item Reduce code mainitainabilty.
		\end{itemize}
