	A table is in 5NF if:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is already in 4NF.
		
		\item We need to decompose a table to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.
		
		\item Example (without 5NF): Imagine a company where you have employees, projects, and the roles that employees perform on each project. 
		
		\item Suppose you have the following table:
		
		\newimage{0.36}{content/chapter11/images/5nf1.png}		
		
		\item Problems: In this table:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Employee 1 (ID = 1) works on Project 101 as both Manager and Designer.
			\item Employee 2 (ID = 2) works on Project 101 as a Developer and on Project 102 in the same role.
			\item Employee 3 (ID = 3) works on Project 102 as both Manager and Designer.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Decomposing into 5NF: We can break this table into smaller tables to remove redundancy while preserving all relationships.
