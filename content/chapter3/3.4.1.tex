	When you execute COMMIT, the following actions occur:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Changes of all transaction are saved permanently to database.
			\item Locks acquired during the transaction are released, allowing other users to access the affected data.
			\item The changes become visible to other transactions and users.
		\end{itemize}
	All DDL commands causes implicit commit, while you would need to perform implicit command for all DML commands.

	\syntaxblock{
		COMMIT;
	}
	Eg:
	\commandblock{
		// Implicit commit \\
		CREATE TABLE product(no NUMBER, name VARCHAR2(20)); \\
		\\	
		// Explicit commit required \\
		INSERT INTO demo VALUES(101,'chair'); \\
		INSERT INTO demo VALUES(102,'mirror'); \\
		COMMIT; \\
		\\
		// Implicit commit \\
		ALTER TABLE product RENAME COLUMN no TO id; \\
		\\
		// Explicit commit required \\
		UPDATE product SET id=103 WHERE id=102; \\
		COMMIT; 
	}
\end{flushleft}
