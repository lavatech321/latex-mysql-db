	\begin{itemize}
		\item DML commands deal with data only.
		\item DML commands interact with \textbf{buffer first}.
		\item Data will be stored in buffer initially.
		\item On commit, the buffer content will be transferred to database.
		\item You can undo (\textbf{rollback}) the changes before commit.
		\item Due to buffer, the performance is relatively slow.
		\item Row-level locks occur implicitly on the modified rows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Write operations in DML places \textbf{implicit row-level lock on rows} being modified for that particular user. 
			\item If 100 rows are deleted/modified, those row will be locked for that user. \item Once record is locked, other users cannot modify the row unless lock owner releases the lock. 
			\item However locked row is readable by other users.
		\end{itemize}
