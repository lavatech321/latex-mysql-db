		\item Daemon thhread are thread executing in the background.
		\item Eg:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Garbage Collector
			\item Singal Dispacter
			\item Attach Listener etc.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Daemon thread support non-daemon threads(like main thread).
		\item Eg: Main thread running with low memory, causes JVM to runs garbage collector to free memory.
		\item Usually daemon threads have low priority, but can have high priority also.
		\item Method to check daemon nature of a thread:
		\bigskip
		\syntaxblock{
			public boolean isDaemon()
		}
		\item Method to change daemon nature of a thread:
		\bigskip
		\syntaxblock{
			public void setDaemon(boolean b)
		}
		\item Daemon nature can be changed before starting of a thread. 
		\item After starting a thread, nature of thread can't be changed.
