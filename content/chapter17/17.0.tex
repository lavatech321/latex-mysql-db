		\textbf{Executing multiple task at a time is multi-tasking}. Types of multi-tasking are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Process-Based multi-tasking}: OS can perform multiple task independently at a time like:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Play audio songs
				\item Execute Java program
				\item Play movie etc.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\item \textbf{Thread-Based multi-tasking:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Task executed simultaneously where \textbf{each task is separate part} of a program is called thread-based multi-tasking.
				\item \textbf{Each independent part is called a thread.}
				\item Thread-based multi-tasking is best suitable at programmatic level.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
