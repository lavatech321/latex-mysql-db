	\begin{itemize}
		\item Exception handling handles runtime “exceptional situations”.
		\item  It’s based on you knowing that the method you’re calling is risky (i.e. generate an exception), so that you can write code to deal with it. 
		\item If the exception is not handled properly, it can terminate the program.
		\item Exception handling does not mean repairing an exception.
