	A programmer may have to purposely throw exception for conditions like:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Age less than 0 or more than 120
		\item Invalid phone number 
		\item Invalid email address
		\item Name containing non-alphabetical characters etc.
	\end{itemize}
	This is useful when you want to indicate that a particular condition should be treated as an exception.
